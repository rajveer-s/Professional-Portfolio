## Description
A professional portfolio built with HTML and CSS. Skills such as Flexbox, media queries and CSS variables were used to create the portfolio. A portfolio is created to showcase my skills and talents. As of now I am using placeholder images for my work section and "lorem" for about me section. All the information will be updated in future and work section placeholders will be replaced with deployed projects.
